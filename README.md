# Data-Engineering-Job-Demand-and-Salary
Using Python as a tool, this school project aims to analyze and understand the demand for data engineering jobs based on company profiles. The analysis also explores correlations between job demand, company attributes, and job specifications.
## Analysis Objectives
Explore data engineering job demand by company profile
Find the most and the least needed skills for data engineering jobs
Salary statistical summary
Build a prediction model for salary based on the most relevant job specifications
## ConclusionÂ¶
SQL and Python are the two languages required the most
38% of job postings requiring a degree seem very low
Job experience seems more important than education
For experience requirement, we're not able to tell if it's role experience or experience of a specific skill
Need more data to better analyze certain segments for salary, such as company type and company size
March data alone is insufficient to capture seasonality and therefore does not adequately represent the entire US job market
